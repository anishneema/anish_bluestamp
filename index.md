WALLE ROBOT

Have you ever wanted a personalized robot. Well look no further, WALL-E is here, an automative robot. Moving your hand closer or away from it will change its emotions, and move the robot. To achieve this, I will use the arduino IDE to code each individual part, an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance from the person, and LCD screen and LED lights to control emotions.

# First Milestone

My project is a automative robot which reacts to proximity from one's hand. In milestone 1, I got the LED light and LCD screen to light up and display text and my initials. In doing so, I learned how to code the LED lights in the arduino IDE and the LCD screen. Going foward, I aim to integrate all these components, as well as the sirvos together, so that it reacts correctly to proximity from my hand with the ultrasonic sensor. Once those items are working, I can begin the build of the actual robot with the 3D printed parts

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

# Arduino Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUZZ2V6nGmU?si=mzgKdNSG2Q01wio3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I chose this starter project because it would give me a good introduction into how to code and use the Arduino. Additionally, it gave me great experience with soldering, and electrical components. I now have a basic idea of a circuit, and understand the layout of the breadboard. This knowledge has given me the confidence to continue on my main project, which will use the Arduino extensively, as well as plenty of electrical components. 

![starter project](starterproject.png)
*Figure 1: Arduino and breadboard wiring*

- **Yellow**: provides 5V of power
- **Orange**: connects to ground 
- **Brown**: gives power to button 
- **Black**: gives ground to button 
- **Blue**: provides digital cue 
- **Black**: provides ground to LED with resistor to stop voltage 

When the button is pressed, the circuit is allowed to connect, causing the LED to light up. It is also possible to reverse this effect with the code. 

[Project Guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/Button/):

```cpp
const int buttonPin = 2;  // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin = 13;    // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;  // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}

```

switching HIGH and LOW will reverse the effect of the LED light. Instead of turning on when pressed, it will turn off when pressed.
